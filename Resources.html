					</ul>
			</ul>
			<h2>Acts 28ers and those that teach heretical doctrine</h2>
			<p>Doctrines such as</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Christ was not fully God when He was on earth</li>
					<li>Christ could have sinned</li>
					<li>Christ didn't always know the mystery</li>

			<h2>Other Grace Preachers</h2>
			<p>Some of these teachers I know have doctrinal problems, and others I have just read or heard teach errors</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGG0eOHe0Xm0PRuJHb6mrhw">E C Moore:</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGG0eOHe0Xm0PRuJHb6mrhw">Website</a> | <a href="http://www.trustingthelord.com/Moore.html">Website</a></li>
						<ul>
							<li>He was around a while before any of these other preachers. Steve Atwood and Scott Mitchell have referred to E C Moore having helped them learn the Grace message</li>
							<li>He has some good messages on the Mystery, rightly dividing the Word of Truth and baptism</li>
							<li>Does have some Acts 28 doctrine and Romans 10:9 and 10 for salvation</li>
						</ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.lesfeldick.org/">Les Feldick: </a>Through the Bible</li>
						<ul>
							<li>He corrects the King James Bible alot</li>
							<li>He believes Paul wrote Hebrews</li>
						</ul>
					<li><a href="http://gracefamilybibleonline.com/Site/Welcome.html">Scott Mitchell</a></li>
						<ul>
							<li>I use to listen to his messages alot when I was first learning about rightly dividing. He has alot of good 30 minute messages for people that are just starting to learn.</li>
							<li>They also have there own music group called <a href="http://gracefamilybibleonline.com/Site/Music.html">Berea</a></li>
						</ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/"></a>Berean Bible Society</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This is the big name in the Grace movement, but they put out a lot of wrong doctrine. Several Grace preachers have been a part of this group over the years, or bring their name up</li>
							<li>They put out their own monthly newsletter called <a href="https://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/category/berean-searchlight/">The Berean Searchlight</a></li>
							<li>They also have a daily email they send out with called <a href="https://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/category/two-minutes-with-the-bible/">Two Minutes with the Bible</a></li>
							<li>This to note about them is they still put out alot of doctrine from Grace preachers that are dead and gone. The problem with this is that they still put out the wrong doctrine</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Teaching the twelve disciples were in the Body of Christ</li>
									<li>Calvanism</li>
									<li>Not always having the correct stance on rightly dividing the Word of Truth</li>
									<li>Bereans were unsaved Jews in a synagogue in Acts 17. This name is chosen because they "searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so"</li>
								</ul>
